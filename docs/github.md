> Issues are a great way to keep track of tasks, enhancements, and bugs for your projects. They re kind of like email except they can be shared and discussed with the rest of your team. Most software projects have a bug tracker of some kind. GitHub's tracker is called <strong>Issues</strong>, and has its own section in every repository.

Commit to fix issue

```
git commit -m "fix #34"
```

### Milestones

Once you've collected a lot of issues, you may find it hard to find the ones you care about. <strong>Milestones</strong>, labels, and assignees are great features to filter and categorize issues. A <strong>milestone</strong> acts like a container for issues. This is useful for associating issues with specific features or project phases

### Pull Requests

Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary.
